Cancer hallmark pathway enrichment analysis



# Cancer hallmark definitions were also downloaded from the MSigDB database, and the cancer hallmark pathway enrichment were performed by calculating the probability of overlap between input genes and the hallmark pathway gene sets and evaluated by hyper geometric test with Benjamini-Hochberg (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1997) correction of p-values.
